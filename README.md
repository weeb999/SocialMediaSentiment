## 📂 Dataset

**File:** `social_media_data.csv`

The dataset is synthetically created but mimics real-world social media data.

### Dataset Columns

| Column | Description |
|------|------------|
| platform | Social media platform |
| post_text | Text content of the post |
| likes | Number of likes |
| comments | Number of comments |
| shares | Number of shares |

Each row represents **one social media post**.

## 📈 Key Features

### 🔹 Sentiment Analysis
- Uses **TextBlob** to classify posts as:
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Neutral

### 🔹 Engagement Metric
A custom metric is created:


This represents overall post performance.

### 🔹 Visualizations
- Sentiment distribution  
- Platform-wise engagement  
- Sentiment vs engagement comparison  
- Top performing posts
